# moonraker.conf

[mqtt]
address: 192.168.178.33
#   Address of the Broker.  This may be a hostname or IP Address.  This
#   parameter must be provided.
port: 1883
#   Port the Broker is listening on.  Default is 1883.
client_id: umo-klipper
#   A string client identifer sent by the client to the broker after
#   connecting.  The default is a randomly assigned client id.
enable_tls: False
#   Enables SSL/TLS connections when set to true.  Note that if a user intends
#   to connect to a local MQTT service using a self signed certificate then
#   it will be necessary to install the root CA certificate on the machine
#   hosting Moonraker.  Default is False.
username: mqtt-user
#   An optional username used to log in to the Broker.  This option accepts
#   Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets] section for details. The default is
#   no username (an anonymous login will be attempted).
password: Sc13nc3B1tch
#   An optional password used to log in to the Broker.  This option accepts
#   Jinja2 Templates, see the [secrets] section for details.  The default is
#   no password.
mqtt_protocol: v3.1.1
#   The protocol to use when connecting to the Broker.  May be v3.1,
#   v3.1.1, and v5.  The default is v3.1.1
enable_moonraker_api: True
#   If set to true the MQTT client will subscribe to API topic, ie:
#     {instance_name}/moonraker/api/request
#   This can be set to False if the user does not wish to allow API
#   requests over MQTT.  The default is True.
status_objects:
#   A newline separated list of Klipper objects whose state will be
#   published.  There are two different ways to publish the states - you
#   can use either or both depending on your need.  See the
#   "publish_split_status" options for details.
#
#   For example, this option could be set as follows:
#
#     status_objects:
#       webhooks
#       toolhead=position,print_time,homed_axes
#       extruder=temperature
#
#   In the example above, all fields of the "webhooks" object will be tracked
#   and changes will be published.  Only the "position", "print_time", and
#   "homed_axes" fields of the "toolhead" will be tracked.  Likewise, only the
#   "temperature" field of the extruder will be tracked. See the
#   "Printer Objects" section of the documentation for an overview of the most
#   common objects available.
#
#   Note that Klipper will only push an update to an object/field if the field
#   has changed.  An object with no fields that have changed will not be part
#   of the payload.  Object state is checked and published roughly every 250 ms.
#
#   If not configured then no objects will be tracked and published to
#   the klipper/status topic.
publish_split_status: True
#   Configures how to publish status updates to MQTT.
#
#   When set to False (default), all Klipper object state updates will be
#   published to a single mqtt state with the following topic:
#     {instance_name}/klipper/status
#
#   When set to True, all Klipper object state updates will be published to
#   separate mqtt topics derived from the object and item in the following
#   format:
#     {instance_name}/klipper/state/{objectname}/{statename}
#
#   The actual value of the state is published as "value" to the topic above.
#   For example, if the heater_bed temperature was 24.0, this is the payload:
#     {"eventtime": {timestamp}, "value": 24.0}
#   It would be published to this topic:
#     {instance_name}/klipper/state/heater_bed/temperature
default_qos: 0
#   The default QOS level used when publishing or subscribing to topics.
#   Must be an integer value from 0 to 2.  The default is 0.
